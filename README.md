# The sx props in MUI

The sx prop is a shortcut for defining custom styles that have access to the theme.

The `sx` prop lets you work with a superset of CSS that packages all of the style functions exposed in `@mui/system.` You can specify any valid CSS using this prop, as well as many [theme-aware properties](./sx-props-in-mui/Theme-aware-properties.md) that are unique to MUI System.
