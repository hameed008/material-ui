## What does utility-first CSS framework mean ?

A utility-first CSS framework is a type of CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs directly in your HTML. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use predefined classes to style your elements.

**Key Features:**
**1. Predefined Classes:** Offers a wide range of single-purpose classes for controlling things like padding, margin, color, font size, etc.

**2. No Custom CSS Needed:** You can design elements using just the utility classes, reducing the need for custom CSS.

**3. Highly Customizable:** Easily adaptable for different projects and design needs.

## Example with Tailwind CSS

With Tailwind CSS, instead of writing CSS rules, you use classes like `p-4` for padding, `text-center` for text alignment, and `bg-blue-500` for background color:

```jsx
<!-- Without Tailwind CSS -->
<div style="padding: 16px; text-align: center; background-color: #3b82f6;">
  Hello, World!
</div>

<!-- With Tailwind CSS -->
<div class="p-4 text-center bg-blue-500">
  Hello, World!
</div>

```

**Benefits:**
**1. Speed:** Quickly build and iterate designs without writing custom CSS.

**2. Consistency:** Ensures a consistent design system using standardized classes.

**3. Maintainability:** Easier to maintain and update styles directly in HTML.
In summary, a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS helps you create responsive and consistent designs efficiently by using predefined utility classes.
